<!-- HTML files in Meteor define templates -->
<!-- Meteor parses HTML files and identifies three top-level tags: <head>, <body>, <template>.
Everything inside any <head> tags is added to the 'head' section of the HTML sent to the client, and everything inside <body> tags is added to the 'body' section, just like in a regular HTML file.

Everything inside <template> tags is compiled into Meteor templates, which can be included inside HTML with {{> templateName}} or referenced in your JavaScript with Template.templateName.

Also, the 'body' section can be referenced in your JavaScript with Template.body. Think of it as a special 'parent' template, that can include the other child templates.-->

<!-- Adding logic and data to templates -->
<!-- All of the code in your HTML files is compiled with Meteor's Spacebars compiler. Spacebars uses statements surrounded by double curly braces such as {{#each}} and {{#if}} to let you add logic and data to your views.

You can pass data into templates from your JavaScript code by defining helpers. In the code above, we defined a helper called 'tasts' on Template.body that returns an array. Inside the body tag of the HTML, we can used {{#each tasks}} to iterate over the array and insert a 'task' template for each value. Inside the #each block, we can display the 'text' property of each array item using {{text}}. -->
